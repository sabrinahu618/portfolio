			<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My love for technology and problem-solving took off with
				my first invention to help my community during hurricanes.
				I spent that year designing, building, testing, failing, and 
				trying over and over again. I became enamored with the process 
				of turning ideas and possibilities into impact.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fast forward to today... that spark is still going. These past few months, I've 
				been working at the Digital Humanities Lab to build a communication platform 
				for exiled Ukrainian scientists. I've learned how to build websites (like the 
				one you're on right now!), design apps, and create delightful user experiences.
				Of course, the learning never stops. I'm excited to continue growing, especially 
				in the intersection of humanities and STEM.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Beyond this, you can spot me in the wild munching on honey lavender ice cream, 
				strumming my ukulele, sipping hot matcha, or dramatically staring off into space.
